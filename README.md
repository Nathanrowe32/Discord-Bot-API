# discordHypeManBot API

<h2> -- HOW TO SET UP? --  <h2>
 Create a discord bot in discord developer portal and connect to the server.  
 Load the discord bot token into apikeys.py.  
 Set a targetID (discord username) that you want to get hyped up.  
 Set an audio file that you want to be played when the targetID joins a voice channel.  

-- WHAT DOES THIS DO? --  
 This is a very troll bot, when targetID joins a voice channel, the bot will follow and play the audio file of your choosing.  
 Once it is completed the bot will leave the voice channel.
